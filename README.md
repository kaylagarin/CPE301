Spring 2020 CPE 301 

Code provided works in conjunction with tinkercad circuit found at

The purpose of this project was to create an automated hand washing system.

Instructions
To use the simulation, turn the system and faucet on by pressing the push-button on the topmost breadboard. The temperature of the water can be adjusted on the TMP sensor’s slider, also located on the topmost breadboard. Simulate the placement of the user’s hands by clicking on the ultrasonic distance sensor and adjusting the slider as desired. Our system is designed to activate when the sensor detects an object within five inches. The LCD displays the timer and feedback. If the user removes their hands too early, the red led will flash and display feedback on the LCD. When the user washes their hands properly for thirty seconds, the green LED will turn on and display feedback on the LCD for 5 seconds before restarting, waiting for the push button to be pushed again.
